# Booleans

The `bool` class is used to represent boolean values. The `bool` class inherits from the `int` class.

```python
issubclass(bool, int) # True
```

Two built-in constants, `True` and `False` are singleton instances of the bool class with underlying `int` values of 1 and 0 respectively. These two values are instances of the `bool` class, and by inheritance are also `int` objects.

```python
isinstance(True, bool) # True
isinstance(True, int) # True
```

## Booleans: Truth Values

All objects in Python have an associated **truth value**, or **truthyness**.
This truthyness has nothing to do with the fact that `bool` is a subclass of `int`. Instead, it has to do with the fact that the `int` class implements a `__bool__()` method.

Most objects will implement either the `__bool__()` or` __len__()` methods. If they don't, then their associated value will be True always.

So what things are falsy in Python?

    * Any zero numeric value is falsy.
    * Any empty sequence type object is falsy.
    * Any empty mapping type will be falsy.
    * The singleton `None` object is always falsy.

### One Application of Truth Values

Why do we care about the truthyness of Python objects? They are useful. Any conditional expression which involves objects other than `bool` types, will use the associated truth value as the result of the conditional expression.

See the following examples:

```python

a = [1, 2, 3]
if a:
    print(a[0])
else:
    print('a is None, or a is empty.')

# output: 1

a = []
if a:
    print(a[0])
else:
    print('a is None, or a is empty.')

# output: a is None, or a is empty.

```
